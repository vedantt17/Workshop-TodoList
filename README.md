## 🎓 Beginner Exercises (for workshop)
Try these before learning any Git commands:

### 1. Explore the App  
Open `index.html` and try adding tasks, changing priorities, and marking tasks complete.

### 2. Read the Code  
Look inside `script.js` and find:
- Where tasks are stored  
- How new tasks are created  
- How tasks are marked completed  

### 3. Change Something Small  
Open `styles.css` and try changing:
- The background color  
- Button colors  
- Font size of task text  
Then refresh the webpage to see the change.

### 4. Edit This README  
Add one line under this section:
> “My favorite part of the app is ______.”

This helps learners understand how file changes look before committing to Git later.
